Slide2Kill-Pro
==============

a MobileSubstrate tweak 's source code

Find description on Cydia

It only works on iOS6, and iOS7 changed the switcher so this tweak is no longer useful in iOS7.

Since I think we should move to the next stage, so I make Slide2Kill-Pro an open source project.

And I provided a initial version (Slide2Kill), it shows the basic function of how the tweak's core features work.
